# Summary
mirrord can be used to either mirror incoming traffic without influencing the return values or it can be used to "override" the container, both options with full access to other resources in the cluster I.E databases other services or even mounted filesystems configmap/secret values.
This allows you to debug your process as if it was already deployed as part of the cluster.

### Teardown
After you're done with the example you can teardown the cluster with

```bash
kubectl delete -f app.yaml
```
