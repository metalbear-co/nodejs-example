For example let's say you want to check what is the response form the database because you encourted some unwanted behavior or just want to develop something new and want to see the real results

Let's make a small change to `./blog/pages/index.tsx`

```diff
export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const authorised = req.cookies['oauth-access-token'] ? !!await jwtVerify(req.cookies['oauth-access-token'], await getRemoteJWKSet()) : false;
 
-  const { rows } = await pg.query(listBlogPreviews.compile({ authorised }));
+  const result = await pg.query(listBlogPreviews.compile({ authorised }));
+
+  console.log(result);
 
   return {
     props: {
-      posts: rows
+      posts: result.rows
     },
   }
 }
```

Now lets see the output

First things first you need to get the pod name from your local cluster

```bash
kubectl get po -l app=example-blog
```

The result should be something like

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-blog-<hash>-<hash>      1/1     Running   0          5m
```

> \<hash\> should be the deployment and replica-set hashes generated on your cluster


And now lets test it
