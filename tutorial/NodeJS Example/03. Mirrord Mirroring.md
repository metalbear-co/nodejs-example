# Mirrord Mirroring

First thing for this example you will need to build the local auditor service

```bash
yarn && yarn workspace auditor build
```

Next you need to get the pod name from your local cluster

```bash
kubectl get po -l app=example-auditor
```

The result should be something like

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-auditor-<hash>-<hash>      1/1     Running   0          5m
```

Now lets debug the container in the cluster by executing

```bash
mirrord exec -p example-auditor-<hash>-<hash> yarn -- workspace auditor start
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:30080 and you should start seeing "audit" logs on your local machine, the requests that the example-blog is sending to the example-auditor in the cluster are mirrored and sent to your local machine as well
